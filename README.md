Tired of hitting the 50 message limit for pins? Use QuoteBot to save as many
of your favorite messages as you want!

## What is QuoteBot?

Ever tried to pin a message in a channel and get an error that you're at the
pinned message limit? This is the problem QuoteBot solves. Instead of pinning
messages, QuoteBot embeds your favorite messages into a dedicated text channel
specified by a server admin.
